# README

This folder contains 4 markdown files with the SPARQL requests specialized to build the KG of plots.

Initial named graphs are described in the *data/cadaster* folder of this repository.

After having added the data into the initial named graphs, the algorithm files have to be executed in the following order :
1. Custom functions
2. Sanity checks
3. Update initial datas
4. Build KG

SPARQL requests to answer the competency questions are in the XXX_sparql_request file of the */documentation/cadaster* folder of this repository.
